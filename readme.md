# Minimal Drag and Drop Image sequence to Video Converter

The goal is to have a simple way to compile a video file from a "numbered" image sequence.

For now, you need to drag and drop a **directory** containing said image sequence.

## TODOS

- Have a number of useful (but limited) presets and options

## Needs Fixing

### Numbers need to be padded

i.e :

    image.0001.jpg
    image.0002.jpg
    image.0003.jpg
    etc

NOT :

    image.1.jpg
    image.2.jpg
    image.3.jpg
    etc

    This Won't work
